# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
The Real Estate Price Prediction project is a live web application designed to predict property prices based on various factors such as location, size, and amenities. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to provide accurate price estimations, helping users make informed decisions in the real estate market.

Features

1) Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes advanced machine learning models to predict real estate prices.
2) User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive front-end design, making it easy for users to input property details and obtain price predictions.
3) Real-Time Predictions: Provides instant predictions based on the data provided by the user.
4) Scalable Database: Uses SQLite3 for managing property data efficiently.

Technologies Used
Front-End: HTML, CSS
Back-End: Python, Django Framework
Database: SQLite3
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for model development and deployment


How It Works
Data Collection: User inputs property details such as location, area, and other relevant features.
Model Processing: The application processes this data through a trained machine learning model.
Price Prediction: The model predicts the property's price based on the input data, which is then displayed to the user.
